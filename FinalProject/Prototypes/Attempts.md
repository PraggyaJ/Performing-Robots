## Plans
The project requires two robots: a small one that is being 'constructed' in the play and another bigger robot that is constructing the smaller one.

## Smaller robot
The main features of the smaller robot are:
- cute appearance
- attachable arms (double-sided tape/magnets)
- empty container/hole to contain things
- some 'components' of it made of foam
