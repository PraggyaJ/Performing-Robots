The initial prototyped model from [protoypes](https://github.com/PraggyaJ/Performing-Robots/blob/master/FinalProject/Prototypes/Attempts.md) had all the right aspects but not the right features. So, I decided to alter the designs. I started building from scratch trying to mimick a balloon shaped body to make it more rounder and hence, cuter.
