Features Of Robot (Praggya/Paulin/Max)

Our robot will be able to move on a track that is either drawn or put together (like puzzle pieces) by the audience. A kinect will track the audience memberâ€™s hand movement and the robot will mimic that and change facial expressions accordingly (all while following the track).

 Process

We divided up the tasks and proceeded on our own pace. Max worked on the base and getting the robot to follow the track . Paulin worked on getting the audience to control the hands (bluetooth) and the kinect. Praggya worked on the face, facial expressions and the constructions of the hands and body.
