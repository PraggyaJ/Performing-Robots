Performer vs. Prop
The theatrical aspects of the robot’s performance
- Appearance (robot morphology, e.g. machinic, biomorphic, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic)
- Behaviour (the robot’s movement and actions including its interaction with its environment and other ‘actors’)
- Context (the performance context of the robot including aspects of theatrical mise-en-scene such as setting, props and lighting)

Robots need to evoke emotions as performer
